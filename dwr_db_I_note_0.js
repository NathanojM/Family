To Rowland my father presented the image of capitalism because of his reasonably com-fortable life style. The friendship between my father and Rowland had always been precarious for three main reasons. Firstly my father was the son of Mary Jane Ford (known colloquially as `Ellen'; I never knew why), the sight of whom he had hated ever since she had married his brother Herbert. Rowland had never approved of that match. Mary Ford had been \"in service\" as a cook to some branch of the Sneyd family, of whom Rowland probably didn't approve either! He considered that Herbert had married beneath his `station'. Secondly, despite their obvious difference in age, Rowland had been extremely fond of my mother, before her marriage to my father, of course. But it must have been through my father, however, that he first made my mother's acquaintance. To some extent my mother must have been flattered by his attention because she used to tell how, whenever they (she and Rowland) walked out together and my mother was in her Naval Nurse uniform, Rowland would be very impressed that she was entitled to a salute from military and naval personnel. He was always keen that she should insist that this courtesy was extended to her because her nursing status was equivalent to His Majesty's Commission. (How Rowland reconciled this with his extreme left wing views I could never understand; even as a child I was aware of many inconsistencies in his philosophy). From occasional comments my mother had made it was also clear that she visited him, in Sunderland, in his journalist days. I suspect that the answer may lie in the suspicion that my father was initially more attracted to my mother's sister `Elsie' (actually Lottie Clay, initials `L. C. '), but she became rapidly blind and died in her early twenties from untreatable diabetes, aggravated by tuberculosis. Thirdly, my father refused to patronise Rowland's camp site. It was a sore point with Rowland that my father actually preferred to pay good money to stay at a `boarding house' than to accept the special terms and treatment that Rowland would have offered him. I knew that my father was too fond of home comforts and, of course, I was still rather young for camping when the offer was first extended. The cliffs immediately outside the tents were unfenced and very dangerous. Also my father must have known of the former association between Rowland and my mother, which was a potential, if not real, embarrassment. <br />\nThus, when we visited Rowland from Paignton, we were by no means guaranteed a welcome. He could be very insulting. In fact, on the last such occasion, my father had actually sent me down from the lane, through the wood, to see him first. Rowland did not like unannounced visitors either!. I had met Rowland half way down to the bungalow on the path and his immediate reaction was to read me a diatribe about trespassing and order me off his premises; this was typical. However, I was fairly certain that he had recognised me, but was pretending that he didn't want to know. When I stood my ground, I was only a kid at the time, I think he admired my pluck as much as anything. He relented and invited us all in for tea and seemed to enjoy our visit. He was a strange man. His appearance was formidable; he had a full beard and he was at least six feet tall, even at nearly 70 years old, and very straight backed. Also he was still virile and healthily tanned from a lifetime spent mostly outdoors in all weathers. He enforced his campsite rules, which were posted all around the site, with military strictness and was known to order people off the site for even minor infringement. I adored him, and I think he was quite fond of me too, probably more fond of me than of my father, because my father's `sins' were not my fault and my potential `sins' were my father's fault! Also I was Rene's child. <br />\nWhere Marion and Rowland had chosen to build their bungalow was a brief plateau on the the cliff top, the adjacent cliff top, to the west, where the campsite was situated, being slightly higher and more exposed. Behind the bungalow the ground, which had become a dense spruce plantation, rose steeply for at least 100 feet to the access lane from Stoke Fleming, which was about a mile away. The gentler slope, flanking the campsite plateau, was not so densely wooded and one of the paths to the lane ran along the side of this slope. Rowland's was the last but one property at the far end of the lane from the village. His neighbours were considerably more affluent than he and he had little contact with them. He called them parasites. They were not completely happy about his campsite, but it was quite legitimate. However, there was some liaison between Rowland and one of these adjoining neighbours, who was a writer and correspondent of some national repute. <br />\nOn the opposite side of the bungalow to the camp site there was a deep cleft in the cliffs, through which a stream from the fields above ran down to the sea. At the base of the cliffs the stream crossed a small sandy cove, which also belonged to Rowland, being continuous with his cliff top estate. <br />\nWhen he had first bought the land, which he called Rockvale Cove, the beach had been almost inaccessible. Where the beachward path from his bungalow reached the cleft in the cliffs, he had, himself, built a system of concrete steps and strong preserved and tarred wooden foot-bridges crisscrossing the `ravine' down to the beach. The last drop to the beach required descent of a short vertical rock face aided by footholes cut out of the bare rock and a strong iron hand chain, firmly anchored in the rock. The height of this final drop to the beach varied from 5 or 6 feet to possibly 15 feet according to the tides. In the winter high tides would completely swamp the beach and rearrange the sand levels and the course of the stream across the beach. Bathing in the sea was not recommended, unless a very experienced swimmer, as currents and submerged rocks were treacherous, but I seem to remember `paddling' there. It was not a place for the infirm. To me it was a paradise, but Rowland would never allow any children to go to the beach without an adult. I don't think that he was too happy about children on the site at all. Where the bridges crossed, there was an attractive, but inaccessible, waterfall of about 30 feet. <br />\nThe first gate from the lane led at first through trees and then across the slope below the campsite, perhaps 200 - 300 yards; a right turn then took one up to the campsite (which was always forbidden for me to enter) and turning left took one gently down and eventually along the front of the bungalow. Straight ahead, where there was no path and only short grass and a little bracken, took one to the cliff edge!<br />\nContinuing past the first entrance gate further down the rough, rock-surfaced, narrowed lane, for some 200 yards, with a weathered dry stone wall and trees at right and more trees bordering fields on the left, reached the second gate in the stone wall. (Both gates were iron and could be securely padlocked to exclude unwanted visitors if necessary). Straight ahead was a farm gate leading eventually to the last property; the lane finished here. <br />\nFrom the second gate steps descended steeply to the opposite end of the bungalow. The steps were cut shallowly into a soil path with large flat stones forming the treads. On the right was the dense spruce wood. On the left was a wild, windswept, natural acre or so of rough grass with occasional bracken and brambles across to the top end of the cleft in the cliff, at the top of which the stream entered Rowland's land. Turning right at the bottom of the steps took you along the front of the bungalow, continuous with the other path down from the campsite. There was a rough `garden' in front of the bungalow which boasted a few brave flowers, but the shallow skim of soil over the rock was inhospitable to all but extremely hardy plants. Ahead was the path to the beach. Turning left the level path crossed the uncultivated area of bracken, grass and brambles. Following this path for some 150 yards brought you to a little hut hidden amongst some struggling windswept bushes; this was the primitive toilet for the bungalow! Looking seaward from this path, which ran parallel to the coastline there was a fantastic view of the coast and the larger sweep of Start Bay. There were sveral little rocks protruding from the sea just off the headland which marked the eastern flank of the cove (I think Rowland called them the `Seven Sisters', but they were not always all visible). The view of Blackpool Sands and Slapton Sands was just hidden behind the top of the cliff to the west. Amongst the brambles and bracken, on a hot sunny afternoon I once saw an adder for the first time along this path. But hard luck for anybody needing to visit that little hut in bad weather! <br />\nIn arranging to visit Rowland, then, my mother and I knew what to expect. We knew in advance that I would sleep in a tent and my mother was assigned one of the coveted wooden huts - Rowland's `luxury' accommodation for special guests. I think Marion had been using it; she and Rowland occasionally had some sort of `estrangement', I believe. I gleaned that their life together had not been exactly blissful. The hut was situated in the trees near the first gate, alongside a level stretch of the entrance path from the first gate. The hut was near to the junction with another path which ran parallel to the lane, through the trees, near to the the top wall. The path was well carpeted with pine needles and several hundred yards from the bungalow, quiet, isolated and out of earshot of the bungalow. My tent was within shouting distance of mother's hut, further along the path and surrounded by trees on three sides. <br />\nThe nearest railway station to Stoke Fleming was Kingswear (for Dartmouth) and there was a rather infrequent bus service from the quayside at Dartmouth to Plymouth via Stoke Fleming and Kingsbridge. Pray that the train would not be late. Our first minor mistake was to opt to travel via Birmingham, but Rowland had asked us, en route, to buy a particular model of wood plane for him, which he seemed to think could only be purchased at a specific shop in Birmingham. Not wishing to argue with Rowland, we organised our journey accordingly and we left our meagre luggage as `left luggage' at New Street station whilst finding the shop, successfully in the event. However we felt sure that we could have bought the same plane in Hanley and saved a lot of time and trouble; but we would not tell Rowland that! Fortunately we did not have to change stations at Birmingham; we were able to catch a convenient connection as far as Bristol, still within the L. M. S. system. At Bristol, Temple Meads, we transferred to a G. W. R. connection for Newton Abbot, with a further easy change of train at Newton Abbot to the Torquay, Paignton and Kingswear branch. All the trains were very full and we were lucky to find seats. From Kingswear we crossed the passenger ferry to Dartmouth, which connected with the train service. We just made it to the last bus for Plymouth, which left about 4. 30 p. m. Uncle Rowland met us at Dartmouth and travelled with us on the bus, carrying all our `luggage'. The bus journey as far as Stoke Fleming took about 35 minutes. Progress out of Dartmouth was slow because of the steep winding hill up to the plain above. <br />\nIn the village, Rowland collected what he called his `dog-cart' on which to trundle our small cases along the rough lane to Rockvale Cove. The lane leaves the village down a 1:5 hill, then rises again only a little more gently before more or less levelling off. The first hill, though narrow, had been asphalted at some time, but beyond this the lane became rougher and stonier, eventually dwindling to a cart track. <br />\nWhenever my parents and I had visited Paignton, on holiday, before the war (staying with Mrs. Coombe at Marldon), we had managed to pay a `courtesy' visit to Uncle Rowland. To Rowland my father presented the image of capitalism because of his reasonably com-fortable life style.

The school still boasted just a few 'boarders'. Attendance at this school was still regarded as a coveted privilege and the academic record was good. My father, however, had never been happy at the school because of the somewhat upper crust attitudes which were apparently reflected in both the teachers and their teaching. Father, being of humble nature and background, had been made to feel the lowliness of his 'station' by the attitudes of both staff and other more affluent pupils. His bitterness was further emphasised when he was forced to discontinue his education by the untimely death of his father - my father would like to have continued in the sixth form. His mother was reduced by this event to such dire straits as no longer to be able to pay his school fees nor, indeed, to manage financially without a contribution from him by way of earnings. In short, a most promising career prospect had been dashed. <br />\nMy paternal grandfather, Herbert, had been a potter's chemist, a comparatively prestigious employment, although not as well paid as it should have been - not an uncommon thing in the early 20th. century. His major contribution to his employers had been some very useful work on pottery glazes, which were of considerable importance in pottery manufacture. However, the full hazards of work in the field of chemistry were not then appreciated, in particular the toxic nature of compounds of lead. His death was directly attributable to lead poisoning, which had built up over the years. But the fatality came unexpectedly, such that my grandmother was suddenly left, with young Ethel, and no income whatever. For her husband's note books, containing the results of work invaluable to his employers, she was offered the sum of \u00a350! Not being able to afford solicitor's (or any other) advice, indeed not realising that such advice should have been sought, she accepted this settlement for his 'life's work'. One of my paternal grandfather's brothers, Rowland, had never liked Mary Jane and he never forgave her for her lack of initiative in this matter. (He lived and worked in Sunderland at the time). He was a very left wing socialist journalist/reporter with political aspirations (which were never to be realised) and he utterly despised the capitalist attitudes of Herbert's employer. Herbert's wife should have been compensated; Herbert's premature death was a direct consequence of unwarranted exposure to toxic substances in the course of their service; Mary Jane should have stood up for her rights. Whether such a claim for compensation, at that time, would or could ever have succeeded is a moot question. The hard fact is that it was not even pursued and the consequences fell mainly upon my father. If my paternal grandmother had a malevolent disposition, and many former acquaintances and neighbours claimed to have been materially scandalised by the wickedness of her tongue, (despite her long association with the Methodist Church), it may be charitable to attribute some of her bitterness to this experience. Nevertheless, in my lifetime and in her old-age, there were few who retained a charitable image of my grandmother, least of all my mother. <br />\nMy father, then, forced to leave school without completing his anticipated full education, (although he did reach matriculation), found employment in a junior capacity with the City of Stoke-on-Trent corporation, in the town-planning department. During this time he qualified as a draughtsman and finally achieved A. M. I. Mun. E. , (Associateship of the Institute of Municipal Engineers), by attendance at evening classes. This made him eligible for promotion in the field of technical aspects of Local Government.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nMemoir by John Nicholas Barrett\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Before accounting for the remaining year at the Junior School I need to make mention of my memories of my paternal grandmother and my father's unmarried younger sister. During the period before I started school, My grandmother and aunt (Ethel) lived in Telwright Street, Burslem. This was true `Arnold Bennett' country, almost within shouting distance of Bennett's \"Duck Bank\". <br />\nI can still picture my grandmother's blackened terrace house, which I suppose was a rented Council house and had probably been my father's one time home (although I never made this conscious connection at the time).

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nMemoir by John Nicholas Barrett\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Shortly after the move from Telwright Street to Leonard Drive, however, my Aunt Ethel became increasingly unable to continue her employment. Finally her condition was diagnosed as \"Disseminating Sclerosis\" of which the symptoms were bouts of semi-paralysis and uncontrollable trembling, especially making the hands tremble. As the 'disease' became worse it also began to affect her mental faculties too - although these had never been particularly brilliant before. She became even more childishly dependent on her mother. I am convinced that, at least initially, her problems were psychosomatic, because her mother had never permitted her a will of her own. Even an erstwhile suitor had eventually been discouraged by her mother's domination of her life, although I understood that the 'match' (had it ever come to pass!) would have been fraught with other problems, discussion of which always seemed the subject of unspoken taboo. Strangely, my Aunt had been an accomplished pianist (and church organist) and boasted L. L. C. M. and A. R. C. O. (I never knew how or when!). She was well respected locally as an accompanist for singers and solo instrumentalists at concerts and she used to accompany my father, who was also a violinist in the N. Staffs, Symphony Orchestra. She also used once to give piano lessons. The onset of Disseminating Sclerosis was, for her, a cruel twist of fate since she became increasingly unable to play, being unable to control her shaking hands. But in the early years she did have quite extensive periods of remission; however, because of the unpredictability, she was obliged to relinquish her organist post at High Lane Methodist Church as her capabilities deteriorated.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nMemoir by John Nicholas Barrett\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Before accounting for the remaining year at the Junior School I need to make mention of my memories of my paternal grandmother and my father's unmarried younger sister.

To Rowland my father presented the image of capitalism because of his reasonably com-fortable life style. The friendship between my father and Rowland had always been precarious for three main reasons. Firstly my father was the son of Mary Jane Ford (known colloquially as `Ellen'; I never knew why), the sight of whom he had hated ever since she had married his brother Herbert. Rowland had never approved of that match. Mary Ford had been \"in service\" as a cook to some branch of the Sneyd family, of whom Rowland probably didn't approve either! He considered that Herbert had married beneath his `station'. Secondly, despite their obvious difference in age, Rowland had been extremely fond of my mother, before her marriage to my father, of course. But it must have been through my father, however, that he first made my mother's acquaintance. To some extent my mother must have been flattered by his attention because she used to tell how, whenever they (she and Rowland) walked out together and my mother was in her Naval Nurse uniform, Rowland would be very impressed that she was entitled to a salute from military and naval personnel. He was always keen that she should insist that this courtesy was extended to her because her nursing status was equivalent to His Majesty's Commission. (How Rowland reconciled this with his extreme left wing views I could never understand; even as a child I was aware of many inconsistencies in his philosophy). From occasional comments my mother had made it was also clear that she visited him, in Sunderland, in his journalist days. I suspect that the answer may lie in the suspicion that my father was initially more attracted to my mother's sister `Elsie' (actually Lottie Clay, initials `L. C. '), but she became rapidly blind and died in her early twenties from untreatable diabetes, aggravated by tuberculosis. Thirdly, my father refused to patronise Rowland's camp site. It was a sore point with Rowland that my father actually preferred to pay good money to stay at a `boarding house' than to accept the special terms and treatment that Rowland would have offered him. I knew that my father was too fond of home comforts and, of course, I was still rather young for camping when the offer was first extended. The cliffs immediately outside the tents were unfenced and very dangerous. Also my father must have known of the former association between Rowland and my mother, which was a potential, if not real, embarrassment. <br />\nThus, when we visited Rowland from Paignton, we were by no means guaranteed a welcome. He could be very insulting. In fact, on the last such occasion, my father had actually sent me down from the lane, through the wood, to see him first. Rowland did not like unannounced visitors either!. I had met Rowland half way down to the bungalow on the path and his immediate reaction was to read me a diatribe about trespassing and order me off his premises; this was typical. However, I was fairly certain that he had recognised me, but was pretending that he didn't want to know. When I stood my ground, I was only a kid at the time, I think he admired my pluck as much as anything. He relented and invited us all in for tea and seemed to enjoy our visit. He was a strange man. His appearance was formidable; he had a full beard and he was at least six feet tall, even at nearly 70 years old, and very straight backed. Also he was still virile and healthily tanned from a lifetime spent mostly outdoors in all weathers. He enforced his campsite rules, which were posted all around the site, with military strictness and was known to order people off the site for even minor infringement. I adored him, and I think he was quite fond of me too, probably more fond of me than of my father, because my father's `sins' were not my fault and my potential `sins' were my father's fault! Also I was Rene's child. <br />\nWhere Marion and Rowland had chosen to build their bungalow was a brief plateau on the the cliff top, the adjacent cliff top, to the west, where the campsite was situated, being slightly higher and more exposed. Behind the bungalow the ground, which had become a dense spruce plantation, rose steeply for at least 100 feet to the access lane from Stoke Fleming, which was about a mile away. The gentler slope, flanking the campsite plateau, was not so densely wooded and one of the paths to the lane ran along the side of this slope. Rowland's was the last but one property at the far end of the lane from the village. His neighbours were considerably more affluent than he and he had little contact with them. He called them parasites. They were not completely happy about his campsite, but it was quite legitimate. However, there was some liaison between Rowland and one of these adjoining neighbours, who was a writer and correspondent of some national repute. <br />\nOn the opposite side of the bungalow to the camp site there was a deep cleft in the cliffs, through which a stream from the fields above ran down to the sea. At the base of the cliffs the stream crossed a small sandy cove, which also belonged to Rowland, being continuous with his cliff top estate. <br />\nWhen he had first bought the land, which he called Rockvale Cove, the beach had been almost inaccessible. Where the beachward path from his bungalow reached the cleft in the cliffs, he had, himself, built a system of concrete steps and strong preserved and tarred wooden foot-bridges crisscrossing the `ravine' down to the beach. The last drop to the beach required descent of a short vertical rock face aided by footholes cut out of the bare rock and a strong iron hand chain, firmly anchored in the rock. The height of this final drop to the beach varied from 5 or 6 feet to possibly 15 feet according to the tides. In the winter high tides would completely swamp the beach and rearrange the sand levels and the course of the stream across the beach. Bathing in the sea was not recommended, unless a very experienced swimmer, as currents and submerged rocks were treacherous, but I seem to remember `paddling' there. It was not a place for the infirm. To me it was a paradise, but Rowland would never allow any children to go to the beach without an adult. I don't think that he was too happy about children on the site at all. Where the bridges crossed, there was an attractive, but inaccessible, waterfall of about 30 feet. <br />\nThe first gate from the lane led at first through trees and then across the slope below the campsite, perhaps 200 - 300 yards; a right turn then took one up to the campsite (which was always forbidden for me to enter) and turning left took one gently down and eventually along the front of the bungalow. Straight ahead, where there was no path and only short grass and a little bracken, took one to the cliff edge!<br />\nContinuing past the first entrance gate further down the rough, rock-surfaced, narrowed lane, for some 200 yards, with a weathered dry stone wall and trees at right and more trees bordering fields on the left, reached the second gate in the stone wall. (Both gates were iron and could be securely padlocked to exclude unwanted visitors if necessary). Straight ahead was a farm gate leading eventually to the last property; the lane finished here. <br />\nFrom the second gate steps descended steeply to the opposite end of the bungalow. The steps were cut shallowly into a soil path with large flat stones forming the treads. On the right was the dense spruce wood. On the left was a wild, windswept, natural acre or so of rough grass with occasional bracken and brambles across to the top end of the cleft in the cliff, at the top of which the stream entered Rowland's land. Turning right at the bottom of the steps took you along the front of the bungalow, continuous with the other path down from the campsite. There was a rough `garden' in front of the bungalow which boasted a few brave flowers, but the shallow skim of soil over the rock was inhospitable to all but extremely hardy plants. Ahead was the path to the beach. Turning left the level path crossed the uncultivated area of bracken, grass and brambles. Following this path for some 150 yards brought you to a little hut hidden amongst some struggling windswept bushes; this was the primitive toilet for the bungalow! Looking seaward from this path, which ran parallel to the coastline there was a fantastic view of the coast and the larger sweep of Start Bay. There were sveral little rocks protruding from the sea just off the headland which marked the eastern flank of the cove (I think Rowland called them the `Seven Sisters', but they were not always all visible). The view of Blackpool Sands and Slapton Sands was just hidden behind the top of the cliff to the west. Amongst the brambles and bracken, on a hot sunny afternoon I once saw an adder for the first time along this path. But hard luck for anybody needing to visit that little hut in bad weather! <br />\nIn arranging to visit Rowland, then, my mother and I knew what to expect. We knew in advance that I would sleep in a tent and my mother was assigned one of the coveted wooden huts - Rowland's `luxury' accommodation for special guests. I think Marion had been using it; she and Rowland occasionally had some sort of `estrangement', I believe. I gleaned that their life together had not been exactly blissful. The hut was situated in the trees near the first gate, alongside a level stretch of the entrance path from the first gate. The hut was near to the junction with another path which ran parallel to the lane, through the trees, near to the the top wall. The path was well carpeted with pine needles and several hundred yards from the bungalow, quiet, isolated and out of earshot of the bungalow. My tent was within shouting distance of mother's hut, further along the path and surrounded by trees on three sides. <br />\nThe nearest railway station to Stoke Fleming was Kingswear (for Dartmouth) and there was a rather infrequent bus service from the quayside at Dartmouth to Plymouth via Stoke Fleming and Kingsbridge. Pray that the train would not be late. Our first minor mistake was to opt to travel via Birmingham, but Rowland had asked us, en route, to buy a particular model of wood plane for him, which he seemed to think could only be purchased at a specific shop in Birmingham. Not wishing to argue with Rowland, we organised our journey accordingly and we left our meagre luggage as `left luggage' at New Street station whilst finding the shop, successfully in the event. However we felt sure that we could have bought the same plane in Hanley and saved a lot of time and trouble; but we would not tell Rowland that! Fortunately we did not have to change stations at Birmingham; we were able to catch a convenient connection as far as Bristol, still within the L. M. S. system. At Bristol, Temple Meads, we transferred to a G. W. R. connection for Newton Abbot, with a further easy change of train at Newton Abbot to the Torquay, Paignton and Kingswear branch. All the trains were very full and we were lucky to find seats. From Kingswear we crossed the passenger ferry to Dartmouth, which connected with the train service. We just made it to the last bus for Plymouth, which left about 4. 30 p. m. Uncle Rowland met us at Dartmouth and travelled with us on the bus, carrying all our `luggage'. The bus journey as far as Stoke Fleming took about 35 minutes. Progress out of Dartmouth was slow because of the steep winding hill up to the plain above. <br />\nIn the village, Rowland collected what he called his `dog-cart' on which to trundle our small cases along the rough lane to Rockvale Cove. The lane leaves the village down a 1:5 hill, then rises again only a little more gently before more or less levelling off. The first hill, though narrow, had been asphalted at some time, but beyond this the lane became rougher and stonier, eventually dwindling to a cart track. <br />\nWhenever my parents and I had visited Paignton, on holiday, before the war (staying with Mrs. Coombe at Marldon), we had managed to pay a `courtesy' visit to Uncle Rowland. To Rowland my father presented the image of capitalism because of his reasonably com-fortable life style.

I don't think that he was too happy about children on the site at all. Where the bridges crossed, there was an attractive, but inaccessible, waterfall of about 30 feet. <br />\nThe first gate from the lane led at first through trees and then across the slope below the campsite, perhaps 200 - 300 yards; a right turn then took one up to the campsite (which was always forbidden for me to enter) and turning left took one gently down and eventually along the front of the bungalow. Straight ahead, where there was no path and only short grass and a little bracken, took one to the cliff edge!<br />\nContinuing past the first entrance gate further down the rough, rock-surfaced, narrowed lane, for some 200 yards, with a weathered dry stone wall and trees at right and more trees bordering fields on the left, reached the second gate in the stone wall. (Both gates were iron and could be securely padlocked to exclude unwanted visitors if necessary). Straight ahead was a farm gate leading eventually to the last property; the lane finished here. <br />\nFrom the second gate steps descended steeply to the opposite end of the bungalow. The steps were cut shallowly into a soil path with large flat stones forming the treads. On the right was the dense spruce wood. On the left was a wild, windswept, natural acre or so of rough grass with occasional bracken and brambles across to the top end of the cleft in the cliff, at the top of which the stream entered Rowland's land. Turning right at the bottom of the steps took you along the front of the bungalow, continuous with the other path down from the campsite. There was a rough `garden' in front of the bungalow which boasted a few brave flowers, but the shallow skim of soil over the rock was inhospitable to all but extremely hardy plants. Ahead was the path to the beach. Turning left the level path crossed the uncultivated area of bracken, grass and brambles. Following this path for some 150 yards brought you to a little hut hidden amongst some struggling windswept bushes; this was the primitive toilet for the bungalow! Looking seaward from this path, which ran parallel to the coastline there was a fantastic view of the coast and the larger sweep of Start Bay. There were sveral little rocks protruding from the sea just off the headland which marked the eastern flank of the cove (I think Rowland called them the `Seven Sisters', but they were not always all visible). The view of Blackpool Sands and Slapton Sands was just hidden behind the top of the cliff to the west. Amongst the brambles and bracken, on a hot sunny afternoon I once saw an adder for the first time along this path. But hard luck for anybody needing to visit that little hut in bad weather! <br />\nIn arranging to visit Rowland, then, my mother and I knew what to expect. We knew in advance that I would sleep in a tent and my mother was assigned one of the coveted wooden huts - Rowland's `luxury' accommodation for special guests. I think Marion had been using it; she and Rowland occasionally had some sort of `estrangement', I believe. I gleaned that their life together had not been exactly blissful. The hut was situated in the trees near the first gate, alongside a level stretch of the entrance path from the first gate. The hut was near to the junction with another path which ran parallel to the lane, through the trees, near to the the top wall. The path was well carpeted with pine needles and several hundred yards from the bungalow, quiet, isolated and out of earshot of the bungalow. My tent was within shouting distance of mother's hut, further along the path and surrounded by trees on three sides. <br />\nThe nearest railway station to Stoke Fleming was Kingswear (for Dartmouth) and there was a rather infrequent bus service from the quayside at Dartmouth to Plymouth via Stoke Fleming and Kingsbridge. Pray that the train would not be late. Our first minor mistake was to opt to travel via Birmingham, but Rowland had asked us, en route, to buy a particular model of wood plane for him, which he seemed to think could only be purchased at a specific shop in Birmingham. Not wishing to argue with Rowland, we organised our journey accordingly and we left our meagre luggage as `left luggage' at New Street station whilst finding the shop, successfully in the event. However we felt sure that we could have bought the same plane in Hanley and saved a lot of time and trouble; but we would not tell Rowland that! Fortunately we did not have to change stations at Birmingham; we were able to catch a convenient connection as far as Bristol, still within the L. M. S. system. At Bristol, Temple Meads, we transferred to a G. W. R. connection for Newton Abbot, with a further easy change of train at Newton Abbot to the Torquay, Paignton and Kingswear branch. All the trains were very full and we were lucky to find seats. From Kingswear we crossed the passenger ferry to Dartmouth, which connected with the train service. We just made it to the last bus for Plymouth, which left about 4. 30 p. m. Uncle Rowland met us at Dartmouth and travelled with us on the bus, carrying all our `luggage'. The bus journey as far as Stoke Fleming took about 35 minutes. Progress out of Dartmouth was slow because of the steep winding hill up to the plain above. <br />\nIn the village, Rowland collected what he called his `dog-cart' on which to trundle our small cases along the rough lane to Rockvale Cove. The lane leaves the village down a 1:5 hill, then rises again only a little more gently before more or less levelling off. The first hill, though narrow, had been asphalted at some time, but beyond this the lane became rougher and stonier, eventually dwindling to a cart track.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nMemoir by John Nicholas Barrett:\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My father had attended Newcastle High School; it was a minor 'public' school, whose headmaster was a party to the 'Headmaster's Conference'. The school still boasted just a few 'boarders'. Attendance at this school was still regarded as a coveted privilege and the academic record was good. My father, however, had never been happy at the school because of the somewhat upper crust attitudes which were apparently reflected in both the teachers and their teaching. Father, being of humble nature and background, had been made to feel the lowliness of his 'station' by the attitudes of both staff and other more affluent pupils. His bitterness was further emphasised when he was forced to discontinue his education by the untimely death of his father - my father would like to have continued in the sixth form. His mother was reduced by this event to such dire straits as no longer to be able to pay his school fees nor, indeed, to manage financially without a contribution from him by way of earnings. In short, a most promising career prospect had been dashed. <br />\nMy paternal grandfather, Herbert, had been a potter's chemist, a comparatively prestigious employment, although not as well paid as it should have been - not an uncommon thing in the early 20th. century. His major contribution to his employers had been some very useful work on pottery glazes, which were of considerable importance in pottery manufacture. However, the full hazards of work in the field of chemistry were not then appreciated, in particular the toxic nature of compounds of lead. His death was directly attributable to lead poisoning, which had built up over the years. But the fatality came unexpectedly, such that my grandmother was suddenly left, with young Ethel, and no income whatever. For her husband's note books, containing the results of work invaluable to his employers, she was offered the sum of \u00a350! Not being able to afford solicitor's (or any other) advice, indeed not realising that such advice should have been sought, she accepted this settlement for his 'life's work'. One of my paternal grandfather's brothers, Rowland, had never liked Mary Jane and he never forgave her for her lack of initiative in this matter. (He lived and worked in Sunderland at the time). He was a very left wing socialist journalist/reporter with political aspirations (which were never to be realised) and he utterly despised the capitalist attitudes of Herbert's employer. Herbert's wife should have been compensated; Herbert's premature death was a direct consequence of unwarranted exposure to toxic substances in the course of their service; Mary Jane should have stood up for her rights. Whether such a claim for compensation, at that time, would or could ever have succeeded is a moot question. The hard fact is that it was not even pursued and the consequences fell mainly upon my father. If my paternal grandmother had a malevolent disposition, and many former acquaintances and neighbours claimed to have been materially scandalised by the wickedness of her tongue, (despite her long association with the Methodist Church), it may be charitable to attribute some of her bitterness to this experience. Nevertheless, in my lifetime and in her old-age, there were few who retained a charitable image of my grandmother, least of all my mother. <br />\nMy father, then, forced to leave school without completing his anticipated full education, (although he did reach matriculation), found employment in a junior capacity with the City of Stoke-on-Trent corporation, in the town-planning department. During this time he qualified as a draughtsman and finally achieved A. M. I. Mun. E. , (Associateship of the Institute of Municipal Engineers), by attendance at evening classes. This made him eligible for promotion in the field of technical aspects of Local Government.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nOccupation\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nNewspaper editor in 1911.<br />\nSmallholder<br />\nPolitical activist\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\n<strong>Notes written by Lesley Barber</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"She was my maternal grandmother. I don\u2019t know an awful lot about her. And most of that second hand from my mother. There were 6 children [listed elsewhere] and they were very poor. Her father is said to have drunk and left. He died in 1901. Her mother died in 1928 missing my birth by about 3 years. They were both buried in Crediton church graveyard.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn and I went to Devon and Cornwall on holiday one year [2001] we went to the church &nbsp;to see what we could find out &nbsp;and a very helpful gentleman, Mr. Robin Langhorn, &nbsp;told us the graves were not there anymore but they had a plan of the churchyard and a note of the dates of death of &nbsp;Harriet and James.\n</p>\n<p>\nBessie and her siblings had to go to bed when their clothes were washed as they only had one set - which seems a little odd and according to Gill [my sister] our g.grandmother took in washing.<br />\nBessie also cleaned the school house when she was 12 in exchange for schooling. There were 2 schools and it would help to know which school it was to see if there was any more information from there.<br />\nFrom the 1881 census some of the children, including Bessie were in the workhouse [Bessie would have been 5] Perhaps one of the siblings was being born?<br />\nLater Bessie went to London in service and eventually met my grandfather. The story is that he had to hide in the coal cellar when he came courting as callers were not allowed! &nbsp; But very recently I have been talking to Ivy, now 90, [Charlie\u2019s widow] who told me that the people with whom Bessie was in service sent her for cookery class sat Kensington which was where she met my grandfather so they must have thought a lot of her. I have a half tea service that was hers. I remember Alice and Dorothy dividing the full set when they had to sort out the house after Bessie died. I often wonder if it was given to Bessie when she married by the people with whom she was in service.\n</p>\n<p>\nGill and I used to go and see Bessie and William - we called them big Nana and Granddad to distinguish them from our paternal little Nana and Granddad.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy main memory of Big Nana is that she used to sit in the chair by the fire in the room at 7, Windsor Avenue and say she had a bone in her leg and couldn\u2019t walk far! &nbsp;She used to like listening to Mrs. Dale\u2019s Diary as well. Mother and Dorothy had quite a job in the winters to get her to enough coal on the fire to keep warm! I also remember her telling us tell us she wore a bustle when she was young, that she was in service somewhere in London and Granddad hid in the cellar because they weren\u2019t allowed callers. I didn\u2019t know she had trained to be a cook. Mother told me Bessie recited the recipe for Christmas pudding to her when she was first married - so that recipe must have come from Kensington! I still use it today! Mother also told me that when Bessie came to be married our Granddad found out from his birth certificate then that his surname was Dickens and not Morris, he had been brought up by his grandparents in Kent and when they died went to live with his father [ a butcher] in London.<br />\nMy mother, Alice was born 6 &nbsp;March 1903 and Auntie Dorothy 15 September three years later, [I remember that as it is also our wedding anniversary]. I don\u2019t know the dates for Uncle Len and Uncle Charlie.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen mother and Dorothy sorted out Nana\u2019s house they divided her pretty blue and white 12 set tea service between them. When Gill and myself did Dad\u2019s house we discovered mother had a \u00bd dozen tea service of her own as well so rather than divide either of them we tossed for which ever and I ended up with the half of mother\u2019s - I think George has the other half. I have often wondered if it was given to Nana and Granddad by the people she was in service with when she was married!\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1970\u2019s &nbsp;Richard was doing a project about &nbsp;Life in the Olden Days and as Mother and Dad were staying with us at the time she wrote down some of what she could remember of Bessie\u2019s Family. &nbsp;<br />\nshe had five siblings. I am in touch with the grandson of one of them - Bert - Peter Bennellick is the son of &nbsp;Jack, [mother\u2019s cousin who married Beattie], they lived quite near Auntie Dorothy so we saw quite a lot of them when we were children. Peter had an elder brother who had died as a new-born I think. Peter has two children but no grandchildren as yet. He must be about Janet\u2019s age I think.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt doesn\u2019t seem much to remember about a grandparent and just recently I have started writing my own memories for our grand children. It\u2019s so much easier on the computer than writing by hand. I haven\u2019t got very far though! Up to when we moved to Ewell!\n</p>\n<p>\nNana told us her parents [or maybe her grandparents walked from Redruth in Cornwall to Crediton because they had heard there might be work for shoemakers - Bessie\u2019s father was a shoemaker - I seem to remember the uncle [another Fred] in Crowthorne mended shoes. Dorothy and Mother took all us children there in the war when the doodlebugs came To New Malden and Ewell.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nOccupation\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nOwned confectionery shop\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nGeneral\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nMemoir by John Nicholas Barrett\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Whenever my parents and I had visited Paignton, on holiday, before the war (staying with Mrs. Coombe at Marldon), we had managed to pay a `courtesy' visit to Uncle Rowland. To Rowland my father presented the image of capitalism because of his reasonably com-fortable life style. The friendship between my father and Rowland had always been precarious for three main reasons. Firstly my father was the son of Mary Jane Ford (known colloquially as `Ellen'; I never knew why), the sight of whom he had hated ever since she had married his brother Herbert. Rowland had never approved of that match. Mary Ford had been \"in service\" as a cook to some branch of the Sneyd family, of whom Rowland probably didn't approve either! He considered that Herbert had married beneath his `station'. Secondly, despite their obvious difference in age, Rowland had been extremely fond of my mother, before her marriage to my father, of course. But it must have been through my father, however, that he first made my mother's acquaintance. To some extent my mother must have been flattered by his attention because she used to tell how, whenever they (she and Rowland) walked out together and my mother was in her Naval Nurse uniform, Rowland would be very impressed that she was entitled to a salute from military and naval personnel. He was always keen that she should insist that this courtesy was extended to her because her nursing status was equivalent to His Majesty's Commission. (How Rowland reconciled this with his extreme left wing views I could never understand; even as a child I was aware of many inconsistencies in his philosophy). From occasional comments my mother had made it was also clear that she visited him, in Sunderland, in his journalist days. I suspect that the answer may lie in the suspicion that my father was initially more attracted to my mother's sister `Elsie' (actually Lottie Clay, initials `L. C. '), but she became rapidly blind and died in her early twenties from untreatable diabetes, aggravated by tuberculosis. Thirdly, my father refused to patronise Rowland's camp site. It was a sore point with Rowland that my father actually preferred to pay good money to stay at a `boarding house' than to accept the special terms and treatment that Rowland would have offered him. I knew that my father was too fond of home comforts and, of course, I was still rather young for camping when the offer was first extended. The cliffs immediately outside the tents were unfenced and very dangerous. Also my father must have known of the former association between Rowland and my mother, which was a potential, if not real, embarrassment. <br />\nThus, when we visited Rowland from Paignton, we were by no means guaranteed a welcome. He could be very insulting. In fact, on the last such occasion, my father had actually sent me down from the lane, through the wood, to see him first. Rowland did not like unannounced visitors either!. I had met Rowland half way down to the bungalow on the path and his immediate reaction was to read me a diatribe about trespassing and order me off his premises; this was typical. However, I was fairly certain that he had recognised me, but was pretending that he didn't want to know. When I stood my ground, I was only a kid at the time, I think he admired my pluck as much as anything. He relented and invited us all in for tea and seemed to enjoy our visit. He was a strange man. His appearance was formidable; he had a full beard and he was at least six feet tall, even at nearly 70 years old, and very straight backed. Also he was still virile and healthily tanned from a lifetime spent mostly outdoors in all weathers. He enforced his campsite rules, which were posted all around the site, with military strictness and was known to order people off the site for even minor infringement. I adored him, and I think he was quite fond of me too, probably more fond of me than of my father, because my father's `sins' were not my fault and my potential `sins' were my father's fault! Also I was Rene's child. <br />\nWhere Marion and Rowland had chosen to build their bungalow was a brief plateau on the the cliff top, the adjacent cliff top, to the west, where the campsite was situated, being slightly higher and more exposed. Behind the bungalow the ground, which had become a dense spruce plantation, rose steeply for at least 100 feet to the access lane from Stoke Fleming, which was about a mile away. The gentler slope, flanking the campsite plateau, was not so densely wooded and one of the paths to the lane ran along the side of this slope. Rowland's was the last but one property at the far end of the lane from the village. His neighbours were considerably more affluent than he and he had little contact with them. He called them parasites. They were not completely happy about his campsite, but it was quite legitimate. However, there was some liaison between Rowland and one of these adjoining neighbours, who was a writer and correspondent of some national repute. <br />\nOn the opposite side of the bungalow to the camp site there was a deep cleft in the cliffs, through which a stream from the fields above ran down to the sea. At the base of the cliffs the stream crossed a small sandy cove, which also belonged to Rowland, being continuous with his cliff top estate. <br />\nWhen he had first bought the land, which he called Rockvale Cove, the beach had been almost inaccessible. Where the beachward path from his bungalow reached the cleft in the cliffs, he had, himself, built a system of concrete steps and strong preserved and tarred wooden foot-bridges crisscrossing the `ravine' down to the beach. The last drop to the beach required descent of a short vertical rock face aided by footholes cut out of the bare rock and a strong iron hand chain, firmly anchored in the rock. The height of this final drop to the beach varied from 5 or 6 feet to possibly 15 feet according to the tides. In the winter high tides would completely swamp the beach and rearrange the sand levels and the course of the stream across the beach. Bathing in the sea was not recommended, unless a very experienced swimmer, as currents and submerged rocks were treacherous, but I seem to remember `paddling' there. It was not a place for the infirm. To me it was a paradise, but Rowland would never allow any children to go to the beach without an adult. I don't think that he was too happy about children on the site at all. Where the bridges crossed, there was an attractive, but inaccessible, waterfall of about 30 feet. <br />\nThe first gate from the lane led at first through trees and then across the slope below the campsite, perhaps 200 - 300 yards; a right turn then took one up to the campsite (which was always forbidden for me to enter) and turning left took one gently down and eventually along the front of the bungalow. Straight ahead, where there was no path and only short grass and a little bracken, took one to the cliff edge!<br />\nContinuing past the first entrance gate further down the rough, rock-surfaced, narrowed lane, for some 200 yards, with a weathered dry stone wall and trees at right and more trees bordering fields on the left, reached the second gate in the stone wall. (Both gates were iron and could be securely padlocked to exclude unwanted visitors if necessary). Straight ahead was a farm gate leading eventually to the last property; the lane finished here. <br />\nFrom the second gate steps descended steeply to the opposite end of the bungalow. The steps were cut shallowly into a soil path with large flat stones forming the treads. On the right was the dense spruce wood. On the left was a wild, windswept, natural acre or so of rough grass with occasional bracken and brambles across to the top end of the cleft in the cliff, at the top of which the stream entered Rowland's land. Turning right at the bottom of the steps took you along the front of the bungalow, continuous with the other path down from the campsite. There was a rough `garden' in front of the bungalow which boasted a few brave flowers, but the shallow skim of soil over the rock was inhospitable to all but extremely hardy plants. Ahead was the path to the beach. Turning left the level path crossed the uncultivated area of bracken, grass and brambles. Following this path for some 150 yards brought you to a little hut hidden amongst some struggling windswept bushes; this was the primitive toilet for the bungalow! Looking seaward from this path, which ran parallel to the coastline there was a fantastic view of the coast and the larger sweep of Start Bay. There were sveral little rocks protruding from the sea just off the headland which marked the eastern flank of the cove (I think Rowland called them the `Seven Sisters', but they were not always all visible). The view of Blackpool Sands and Slapton Sands was just hidden behind the top of the cliff to the west. Amongst the brambles and bracken, on a hot sunny afternoon I once saw an adder for the first time along this path. But hard luck for anybody needing to visit that little hut in bad weather! <br />\nIn arranging to visit Rowland, then, my mother and I knew what to expect. We knew in advance that I would sleep in a tent and my mother was assigned one of the coveted wooden huts - Rowland's `luxury' accommodation for special guests. I think Marion had been using it; she and Rowland occasionally had some sort of `estrangement', I believe. I gleaned that their life together had not been exactly blissful. The hut was situated in the trees near the first gate, alongside a level stretch of the entrance path from the first gate. The hut was near to the junction with another path which ran parallel to the lane, through the trees, near to the the top wall. The path was well carpeted with pine needles and several hundred yards from the bungalow, quiet, isolated and out of earshot of the bungalow. My tent was within shouting distance of mother's hut, further along the path and surrounded by trees on three sides. <br />\nThe nearest railway station to Stoke Fleming was Kingswear (for Dartmouth) and there was a rather infrequent bus service from the quayside at Dartmouth to Plymouth via Stoke Fleming and Kingsbridge. Pray that the train would not be late. Our first minor mistake was to opt to travel via Birmingham, but Rowland had asked us, en route, to buy a particular model of wood plane for him, which he seemed to think could only be purchased at a specific shop in Birmingham. Not wishing to argue with Rowland, we organised our journey accordingly and we left our meagre luggage as `left luggage' at New Street station whilst finding the shop, successfully in the event. However we felt sure that we could have bought the same plane in Hanley and saved a lot of time and trouble; but we would not tell Rowland that! Fortunately we did not have to change stations at Birmingham; we were able to catch a convenient connection as far as Bristol, still within the L. M. S. system. At Bristol, Temple Meads, we transferred to a G. W. R. connection for Newton Abbot, with a further easy change of train at Newton Abbot to the Torquay, Paignton and Kingswear branch. All the trains were very full and we were lucky to find seats. From Kingswear we crossed the passenger ferry to Dartmouth, which connected with the train service. We just made it to the last bus for Plymouth, which left about 4. 30 p. m. Uncle Rowland met us at Dartmouth and travelled with us on the bus, carrying all our `luggage'. The bus journey as far as Stoke Fleming took about 35 minutes. Progress out of Dartmouth was slow because of the steep winding hill up to the plain above. <br />\nIn the village, Rowland collected what he called his `dog-cart' on which to trundle our small cases along the rough lane to Rockvale Cove. The lane leaves the village down a 1:5 hill, then rises again only a little more gently before more or less levelling off. The first hill, though narrow, had been asphalted at some time, but beyond this the lane became rougher and stonier, eventually dwindling to a cart track. <br />\nWhenever my parents and I had visited Paignton, on holiday, before the war (staying with Mrs. Coombe at Marldon), we had managed to pay a `courtesy' visit to Uncle Rowland. To Rowland my father presented the image of capitalism because of his reasonably com-fortable life style. The friendship between my father and Rowland had always been precarious for three main reasons. Firstly my father was the son of Mary Jane Ford (known colloquially as `Ellen'; I never knew why), the sight of whom he had hated ever since she had married his brother Herbert. Rowland had never approved of that match. Mary Ford had been \"in service\" as a cook to some branch of the Sneyd family, of whom Rowland probably didn't approve either! He considered that Herbert had married beneath his `station'. Secondly, despite their obvious difference in age, Rowland had been extremely fond of my mother, before her marriage to my father, of course. But it must have been through my father, however, that he first made my mother's acquaintance. To some extent my mother must have been flattered by his attention because she used to tell how, whenever they (she and Rowland) walked out together and my mother was in her Naval Nurse uniform, Rowland would be very impressed that she was entitled to a salute from military and naval personnel. He was always keen that she should insist that this courtesy was extended to her because her nursing status was equivalent to His Majesty's Commission. (How Rowland reconciled this with his extreme left wing views I could never understand; even as a child I was aware of many inconsistencies in his philosophy). From occasional comments my mother had made it was also clear that she visited him, in Sunderland, in his journalist days. I suspect that the answer may lie in the suspicion that my father was initially more attracted to my mother's sister `Elsie' (actually Lottie Clay, initials `L. C. '), but she became rapidly blind and died in her early twenties from untreatable diabetes, aggravated by tuberculosis. Thirdly, my father refused to patronise Rowland's camp site. It was a sore point with Rowland that my father actually preferred to pay good money to stay at a `boarding house' than to accept the special terms and treatment that Rowland would have offered him. I knew that my father was too fond of home comforts and, of course, I was still rather young for camping when the offer was first extended. The cliffs immediately outside the tents were unfenced and very dangerous. Also my father must have known of the former association between Rowland and my mother, which was a potential, if not real, embarrassment. <br />\nThus, when we visited Rowland from Paignton, we were by no means guaranteed a welcome. He could be very insulting. In fact, on the last such occasion, my father had actually sent me down from the lane, through the wood, to see him first. Rowland did not like unannounced visitors either!. I had met Rowland half way down to the bungalow on the path and his immediate reaction was to read me a diatribe about trespassing and order me off his premises; this was typical. However, I was fairly certain that he had recognised me, but was pretending that he didn't want to know. When I stood my ground, I was only a kid at the time, I think he admired my pluck as much as anything. He relented and invited us all in for tea and seemed to enjoy our visit. He was a strange man. His appearance was formidable; he had a full beard and he was at least six feet tall, even at nearly 70 years old, and very straight backed. Also he was still virile and healthily tanned from a lifetime spent mostly outdoors in all weathers. He enforced his campsite rules, which were posted all around the site, with military strictness and was known to order people off the site for even minor infringement. I adored him, and I think he was quite fond of me too, probably more fond of me than of my father, because my father's `sins' were not my fault and my potential `sins' were my father's fault! Also I was Rene's child. <br />\nWhere Marion and Rowland had chosen to build their bungalow was a brief plateau on the the cliff top, the adjacent cliff top, to the west, where the campsite was situated, being slightly higher and more exposed. Behind the bungalow the ground, which had become a dense spruce plantation, rose steeply for at least 100 feet to the access lane from Stoke Fleming, which was about a mile away. The gentler slope, flanking the campsite plateau, was not so densely wooded and one of the paths to the lane ran along the side of this slope. Rowland's was the last but one property at the far end of the lane from the village. His neighbours were considerably more affluent than he and he had little contact with them. He called them parasites. They were not completely happy about his campsite, but it was quite legitimate. However, there was some liaison between Rowland and one of these adjoining neighbours, who was a writer and correspondent of some national repute. <br />\nOn the opposite side of the bungalow to the camp site there was a deep cleft in the cliffs, through which a stream from the fields above ran down to the sea. At the base of the cliffs the stream crossed a small sandy cove, which also belonged to Rowland, being continuous with his cliff top estate. <br />\nWhen he had first bought the land, which he called Rockvale Cove, the beach had been almost inaccessible.

During the period before I started school, My grandmother and aunt (Ethel) lived in Telwright Street, Burslem. This was true `Arnold Bennett' country, almost within shouting distance of Bennett's \"Duck Bank\". <br />\nI can still picture my grandmother's blackened terrace house, which I suppose was a rented Council house and had probably been my father's one time home (although I never made this conscious connection at the time). The kitchen, in which they mostly lived, was cramped. The kitchen was dominated by a small kitchen `range'. <br />\nOn the table under the window was an outdated wireless receiver on which, whenever we visited, my father always seemed to have to spend a long time, adjusting or perhaps even repairing. Although, as I discovered as I became older, he was no electrician! The main problem seemed that it always needed accumulators (lead/acid type) changing. He was always muttering about `high tension' and `low tension'; of course, it was not a mains operated wireless. I remember, distinctly, the old speaker with a veneered `sunset' motif containing the speaker fret. Even as a child, I noticed the inferior quality of reproduction. But then, most wireless reproduction was poor in those days. There was no indoor toilet and my mother would always have to accompany me outside, across a tiled yard to a small brick hut just inside the back gate; there was no garden and the backyard gate led into an alley along the backs of the terrace. The rest of the house, the front `parlour' or the upstairs, I don't really remember because I suppose I rarely had cause to see them. It was obvious that my mother was never at ease there and never stayed longer than we had to.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this time, of course, I was not aware of family problems, although I suppose that some of the unease, especially my mother's unease, must have sunk in, if only subliminally. Apparently, my paternal grandmother was violently opposed to my father's marriage; she did not like my mother, not because of any particular shortcoming, but because she foresaw the imminent loss of her strong-willed parental hold over my father. This domination, however, had been mostly lost during the First World War, whilst my father was in the army. After the war, on his return to live at home, my grandmother presumably would have tried to \"reclaim\" him back. Her hold over Ethel could almost be described as evil. My grandmother even insisted that Ethel accompany my mother and father on their honeymoon in Switzerland - and she did!<br />\nMy grandmother was never in receipt of any kind of pension and relied entirely upon my father and Ethel's meagre earnings for financial support. However, grandmother had led a very unfortunate life which had in no way helped to soften a very strong-willed, almost malevolent disposition; the reason for this will be revealed later on. <br />\nSo, I never remember stopping for too long after a meal at my grandmother's; for one thing, my mother would have needed to get me home to bed. I do not remember journeys home again; I never remember travelling with my father on any form of public transport so, perhaps, I was taken home in the motor-cycle sidecar and perhaps I slept on the way home. Alternatively mother took me home, by bus, to be put to bed and father came home later on his motor cycle; the latter is more plausible. \n</p>\n<p>\nCoinciding roughly with the time I started school, my grandmother moved, or was moved by the Council, to a more modern semi-detached Council house, only slightly further out from Burslem centre, in a road on the opposite side of the main thoroughfare off which Telwright Street was situated. I think the old terrace in Telwright Street must have long been due for demolition. At the new house in Leonard Drive she was able to augment her income by taking a lodger. When we visited there, I remember that things seemed much happier. But my memories of visits there are little clearer than those of Telwright Street (although I still recall the geography quite clearly). Through my Infants and Junior School years, then, my paternal grandmother was fairly settled in Leonard Drive and my recollection is that we visited regularly every weekend. When my father acquired a car, the Saturday routine was to attend the Regent Cinema in Hanley for the afternoon showing and then on to Burslem to visit my grandmother and Auntie Ethel for tea.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nOccupation\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nNurse\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

I remembered \"gramps\" with tender affection, but dimly, even now. Gramps had always been so very ill and could not be left alone for long periods. Death was a mystery that I was too young to fathom or to be able to think seriously about. \n</p>\n<p>\nI remembered that Gramps used to live with us at our house, but never came downstairs - he was mostly bedridden. It must have been after that, when I could remember visiting him, with my mother, at a hospital in Poolfields, just a short bus journey away. Subsequently I remembered that we also used to visit him in another hospital at Stone, which involved a long afternoon journey by bus and train and a walk along a canal towpath from Stone railway station to the hospital. I think I regarded these visits with very mixed feelings. I was pleased to see Gramps (and he to see me!) but things were not right; he was so very ill and unhappy and, even I could see, the hospital was not too clean or inviting. (Of course, when I was older, I realised that both the hospitals involved had been `poor law' institutions). <br />\nThese visits and my granfather's death in the Stone establishment must have all occurred before I started school.\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\n\"My Dear Flo,\n</p>\n<p>\nWe were very glad to receive your letter from Japan and to know you were so much better.

We have all been very much concerned about you and have often prayed for you. Lottie has many times wished she could just come over and nurse you. If the CMS committee would only have ordered you to England for a change instead of sending you to Japan, no doubt you would have appreciated the change. You have now been away for 18 months and it only seems as yestererday since we went to the docks with you. You will soon be here again and right well shall we welcome you to old England.

Dulwich is such a pretty district with the parks so near that I can\u2019t think of leaving that district. Then again we have formed friendships here.

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nMemoir by John Nicholas Barrett\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Before accounting for the remaining year at the Junior School I need to make mention of my memories of my paternal grandmother and my father's unmarried younger sister. During the period before I started school, My grandmother and aunt (Ethel) lived in Telwright Street, Burslem. This was true `Arnold Bennett' country, almost within shouting distance of Bennett's \"Duck Bank\". <br />\nI can still picture my grandmother's blackened terrace house, which I suppose was a rented Council house and had probably been my father's one time home (although I never made this conscious connection at the time). The kitchen, in which they mostly lived, was cramped. The kitchen was dominated by a small kitchen `range'. <br />\nOn the table under the window was an outdated wireless receiver on which, whenever we visited, my father always seemed to have to spend a long time, adjusting or perhaps even repairing. Although, as I discovered as I became older, he was no electrician! The main problem seemed that it always needed accumulators (lead/acid type) changing. He was always muttering about `high tension' and `low tension'; of course, it was not a mains operated wireless. I remember, distinctly, the old speaker with a veneered `sunset' motif containing the speaker fret. Even as a child, I noticed the inferior quality of reproduction. But then, most wireless reproduction was poor in those days. There was no indoor toilet and my mother would always have to accompany me outside, across a tiled yard to a small brick hut just inside the back gate; there was no garden and the backyard gate led into an alley along the backs of the terrace. The rest of the house, the front `parlour' or the upstairs, I don't really remember because I suppose I rarely had cause to see them. It was obvious that my mother was never at ease there and never stayed longer than we had to.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this time, of course, I was not aware of family problems, although I suppose that some of the unease, especially my mother's unease, must have sunk in, if only subliminally. Apparently, my paternal grandmother was violently opposed to my father's marriage; she did not like my mother, not because of any particular shortcoming, but because she foresaw the imminent loss of her strong-willed parental hold over my father. This domination, however, had been mostly lost during the First World War, whilst my father was in the army. After the war, on his return to live at home, my grandmother presumably would have tried to \"reclaim\" him back. Her hold over Ethel could almost be described as evil. My grandmother even insisted that Ethel accompany my mother and father on their honeymoon in Switzerland - and she did!<br />\nMy grandmother was never in receipt of any kind of pension and relied entirely upon my father and Ethel's meagre earnings for financial support. However, grandmother had led a very unfortunate life which had in no way helped to soften a very strong-willed, almost malevolent disposition; the reason for this will be revealed later on. <br />\nSo, I never remember stopping for too long after a meal at my grandmother's; for one thing, my mother would have needed to get me home to bed. I do not remember journeys home again; I never remember travelling with my father on any form of public transport so, perhaps, I was taken home in the motor-cycle sidecar and perhaps I slept on the way home. Alternatively mother took me home, by bus, to be put to bed and father came home later on his motor cycle; the latter is more plausible. \n</p>\n<p>\nCoinciding roughly with the time I started school, my grandmother moved, or was moved by the Council, to a more modern semi-detached Council house, only slightly further out from Burslem centre, in a road on the opposite side of the main thoroughfare off which Telwright Street was situated. I think the old terrace in Telwright Street must have long been due for demolition. At the new house in Leonard Drive she was able to augment her income by taking a lodger. When we visited there, I remember that things seemed much happier. But my memories of visits there are little clearer than those of Telwright Street (although I still recall the geography quite clearly). Through my Infants and Junior School years, then, my paternal grandmother was fairly settled in Leonard Drive and my recollection is that we visited regularly every weekend. When my father acquired a car, the Saturday routine was to attend the Regent Cinema in Hanley for the afternoon showing and then on to Burslem to visit my grandmother and Auntie Ethel for tea.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nMemoir by John Nicholas Barrett:\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My father had attended Newcastle High School; it was a minor 'public' school, whose headmaster was a party to the 'Headmaster's Conference'. The school still boasted just a few 'boarders'. Attendance at this school was still regarded as a coveted privilege and the academic record was good. My father, however, had never been happy at the school because of the somewhat upper crust attitudes which were apparently reflected in both the teachers and their teaching. Father, being of humble nature and background, had been made to feel the lowliness of his 'station' by the attitudes of both staff and other more affluent pupils. His bitterness was further emphasised when he was forced to discontinue his education by the untimely death of his father - my father would like to have continued in the sixth form. His mother was reduced by this event to such dire straits as no longer to be able to pay his school fees nor, indeed, to manage financially without a contribution from him by way of earnings. In short, a most promising career prospect had been dashed. <br />\nMy paternal grandfather, Herbert, had been a potter's chemist, a comparatively prestigious employment, although not as well paid as it should have been - not an uncommon thing in the early 20th. century. His major contribution to his employers had been some very useful work on pottery glazes, which were of considerable importance in pottery manufacture. However, the full hazards of work in the field of chemistry were not then appreciated, in particular the toxic nature of compounds of lead. His death was directly attributable to lead poisoning, which had built up over the years. But the fatality came unexpectedly, such that my grandmother was suddenly left, with young Ethel, and no income whatever. For her husband's note books, containing the results of work invaluable to his employers, she was offered the sum of \u00a350! Not being able to afford solicitor's (or any other) advice, indeed not realising that such advice should have been sought, she accepted this settlement for his 'life's work'. One of my paternal grandfather's brothers, Rowland, had never liked Mary Jane and he never forgave her for her lack of initiative in this matter. (He lived and worked in Sunderland at the time). He was a very left wing socialist journalist/reporter with political aspirations (which were never to be realised) and he utterly despised the capitalist attitudes of Herbert's employer. Herbert's wife should have been compensated; Herbert's premature death was a direct consequence of unwarranted exposure to toxic substances in the course of their service; Mary Jane should have stood up for her rights. Whether such a claim for compensation, at that time, would or could ever have succeeded is a moot question. The hard fact is that it was not even pursued and the consequences fell mainly upon my father. If my paternal grandmother had a malevolent disposition, and many former acquaintances and neighbours claimed to have been materially scandalised by the wickedness of her tongue, (despite her long association with the Methodist Church), it may be charitable to attribute some of her bitterness to this experience. Nevertheless, in my lifetime and in her old-age, there were few who retained a charitable image of my grandmother, least of all my mother. <br />\nMy father, then, forced to leave school without completing his anticipated full education, (although he did reach matriculation), found employment in a junior capacity with the City of Stoke-on-Trent corporation, in the town-planning department. During this time he qualified as a draughtsman and finally achieved A. M. I. Mun. E. , (Associateship of the Institute of Municipal Engineers), by attendance at evening classes. This made him eligible for promotion in the field of technical aspects of Local Government.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nJames Cleary and James Stewart Milne Paterson are an enigma that we are yet to solve; very little is known about James Stewart Milne Paterson (who is allegedly my patezrnal grandma's [Barbara McFarlane] grandfather). According to my grandma, when she was a child, she found a box of war medals in her father's [James William Paterson] cupboard that we know did not belong to him, but to a James Francis Cleary. She asked him about them, as any normal child would, but he wouldn't say anything about the medals and demanded that they be put away. She later found that he had obliterated the information from the boxes in an attempt to prevent anybody finding out about whatever had gone on between JSMP and Cleary. We have no idea who Cleary was, his relation to the family or why JSMP had the war medals of another man, only that they were almost definitely in the millitary together.\n</p>\n<p>\nJames William Paterson was very secretive about his ancestry and would never tell my grandma anything. We only know JSMP's name from JWP's birth certifiacte, and that he was in the scots guards. However, we do know that Cleary was in the Irish guards, so why JSMP (a scotsman) was in the Irish guards, remains a mystery.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur leading theory is that Alice Mary Boniwell (JSMP's 'wife') had an affair with Cleary, which drove her to her suicide. We know that AMB was married to JSMP because she was interred as a Paterson. This would explain why JWP kept the medals, even though he was cleary deeply ashamed of them; even though he didn't want anybody to find out about them, he kept them because they were his father's. Clearly (no pun intended), this is pure speculation.\n</p>\n<p>\nCurrently, the latest census avaliable is the 1911 census, because they are not releaed until 100 years have passed since the data was collected, so maybe the 1921 census will tell us something when it is released next year.\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nOccupation\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nTea dealer.

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nThere is a classic family story about a mysterious missionary that went to China and died on the boat coming home. Her picture allegedly fell off the wall on the day she died which is how the family knew. It would have taken weeks for the news to have reached then by conventional means at the time.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe story is partly true and part Chinese whispers. She did go to China as a missionary and we have the documentation containing her instructions and visas. She travelled a lot and at some point she went to Japan from China to recover from something unknown, according to letters from her family. She had friends in Canada, which is where she died suddenly aged 64. She didn't die on the boat but she did die just before returning home. \n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\n\"My Dear Flo,\n</p>\n<p>\nWe were very glad to receive your letter from Japan and to know you were so much better. We trust the stay among the hills will have completely restored you and that on recommencing your work in China you may reap the benefit of the change. We have all been very much concerned about you and have often prayed for you. Lottie has many times wished she could just come over and nurse you. If the CMS committee would only have ordered you to England for a change instead of sending you to Japan, no doubt you would have appreciated the change. You have now been away for 18 months and it only seems as yestererday since we went to the docks with you. You will soon be here again and right well shall we welcome you to old England. In the meantime we pray that God will protect you from all the dangers that your life may be _ to _ in China.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou will nore by the address that I am still at Battersea. I do not suppose I shall be at this school very long. Though I like here very much the headmaster is just such another gentleman as Mr Littlewood, thoroughly kind and sympathetic towards his assistants. Of course it is too far away from home. Dulwich is such a pretty district with the parks so near that I can\u2019t think of leaving that district. Then again we have formed friendships here. It would be very lonely for Lottie were we to remove unto a strange district. A few weeks ago we were at Mrs Felthams to tea. They inquired of you and wished us to convey their kind regards and love. They were very sorry indeed to hear of your _.\n</p>\n<p>\nCousin Christina Clay from _ has been up in London for 5 weeks. She returns in a fortnight to _. She has been learning the bedding trade. Uncle _ Clay is about to start the bedding business in Wales. Sometime next month cousin Walter Ratcliffe is coming for a few days. There is to be a large cycle exhibition in London and while much us will _ the _.\n</p>\n<p>\nBoth he and his wife have had very indifferent health since they were married. Mother wrote saying she might come up along with farther at Xmas. _ I have written them to say we cannot possible do with any visitors at Xmas as we want to have a quiet time to ourselves.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe have had visitors every holiday since we were married and we both think it is time to have a change.\n</p>\n<p>\nThings are going on here much about the same. I am still very busy much evening work. Leon friend has gone to France and as I do not rush to take more penpals in addition to what I have. I have a little more time at my disposal.\n</p>\n<p>\nRenie is getting on splendidly. She walks so well and so distinctly. I wish you could just see her. Lottie is fairly well considering. _ myself I am thankful to say _ _ better. The change during _ holidays did us all good. I shall now have to bring this scribble to a close. I promised Lottie I would drop you a few lines. She is very _ _ 5C. _ _ write to you next week. She wished me not to forget your birthday. She will send you a book next week. We both wish you very many happy returns of the day. Now goodbye. Much _ regards and _ love in which Lottie forms and a lot of kisses from baby.\n</p>\n<p>\nBelieve _\n</p>\n<p>\nEver your loving Brother.
